Throughout the years I've fostered a great deal of creativity and dedication through both outlets and use those skills to drive forward. I've gained proficiency in HTML, CSS/LESS/SASS/Styled Components, JS, React, Redux, Context, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and many other technologies. While always pushing myself to learn more and improve my technical skills I also strive to be a strong leader/team player in any atmosphere I join.",
